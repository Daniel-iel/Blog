## The New Way to Run .NET Apps

Microsoft has announced a new way to run .NET applications in .NET 10. This new feature allows you to run a `.cs` file directly using the `dotnet run app.cs` command, similar to how you can run files in languages like Go, Python, or Node.js.

This enhancement opens up exciting new possibilities in the .NET ecosystem, making development simpler and more streamlined.
